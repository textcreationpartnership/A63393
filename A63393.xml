            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true Relation of a giddy, confuſed Diſcourſe, between a Party of them called QUAKERS, and ſome others, in the Publick Meeting-place at <hi>Weſt-drayton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex; Ian.</hi> 18. 1657.</head>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>That the Scriptures were not the Word of God, becauſe the Devil ſpake ſomething, and</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſomething, which is there written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſtrange kind of Aſſertion: as if nothing of the mind, will, and counſel of God were declared in the Scriptures; becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which the Devil ſpake, and ſomething which <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and other wicked men ſpake is there related; ſo much ſeems to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the reaſon, as brought to prove the Aſſertion: yet do I not beleeve that the perſon aſſerting this doth ſo think, or judge of the Scriptures; for his acknowledgements were more honeſt in many things granted by him, if his heart, and tongue were agreed in the things, which (in words) he ſometimes ſeemed to own: but whitherto can be the tendency of ſuch giddy Doctrins, then to a weakening the authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and begetting in their hearers ſlighting, and undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts concerning the written Word? if this were not the intention of the ſpeaker, it is well: but that the thing ſpoken hath ſuch a tendency in it, who but may eaſily ſee? Yea, and it is much to be feared that ſuch a raſh, and inconſiderate kind of ſpeaking hath brought forth in many an effect of its own likenes,

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48717:4"/> related, and the relation of it; the relation is true, though the thing (as ſpoken by the Devill and wicked men) is falſe: the Scripture doth truly relate ſome things which were falſely ſeoken: And concerning the Doctrinall part of the Scripture: It is a true record of divine Truth concerning things to be beleeved, and done, having its riſe from the pure Fountain, the Spirit of truth.</p>

               <p>(He was one of them called Quakers) <hi>we all hear themſelves acknowledge the Scriptures a declaration of falſehood, as well as of truth; and how then can this be the word of God?</hi>

               <p>Friend do not miſtake nor goe about to pervert my words, I diſtinguiſhed the Scriptures into an Hiſtorical and doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part: And concerning the former I doe not ſay it is a falſe Declaration, although ſome things declared therein are falſe: The Scripture is a true Declaration of whatſoever it Declares, and nothing of falſehood can be charged upon it; it truly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares thoſe falſe things, which ſome wicked ones ſpake: the falſehood is theirs who ſpake it, not the Scripture that relates it: ſome of the Devils words which he (upon ſeverall accaſions) ſpake, are there related; but no where (through the whole Scriptures) are any of the Devils Doctrins taught, but every where declared againſt: and farther, thoſe falſehoods, and blaſphemies which the Devill, and many wicked men ſpake (which are there recorded are not the greateſt part of what is written, but that which is upon accaſion) here, and there mentioned, and the mentioning of theſe things is for our benefit and advantage, that knowing what a one the Devill is we might more carefully watch againſt his wiles: and take heed of aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves with ſuch who are Children like this their Father, leaſt they prove a ſnare to us: And concerning the Doctrinall part of Scripture: you heard me call it; a true record of divine Truth: it is truth both in the declaration, and in the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: and here, I ſhall adde farther.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That theſe Scriptures are no other then the language of the Spirit of truth, which ſpake in thoſe holy men of God, who were the Pen-men thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the ſame Spirit which dwels and ſpeaks in the Saints now with that which dwelt and ſpake in the Saints in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dayes.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48717:5"/>
               <p>Thirdly, The Spirit is ſo one, and ever the ſame with it ſelf, that it never contradicts, or ſpeaks things contrary to it ſelf</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. T.</speaker>
               <p>Then ſo farre we are one: And from this grant we may adde (though it was not then hinted) that what ſoever Spirit brings any other, or teaches contrary Doctrin to what was preached by Chriſt, the Prophets, and Apoſtles (and left upon record in the holy Scriptures, for our learning) is not of God but of the Devil; not the Spirit of Chriſt, but of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (in what garbe ſoever it comes.)</p>

                  <hi>I ſay no more then what the Scripture it ſelf ſayes,</hi> viz. <hi>it is a Diclaration of things that were beleeved,</hi> Luke. 1.1. <hi>For as much as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe things, which are most ſurely beleeved among as: ye ſee here, it is called a Declaration of things that were beleeved: this is Scripture language, a Declaration of things which were beleeved.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. T.</speaker>
               <p>You own it a Declaration of things that were beleeved (in former dayes) but do you own it a Declaration of things that are to be beleeved by us, in this our day, things that we are to beleeve?</p>

               <speaker>E. B.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, which we are to beleeve: but ſtill I ſay, and I pray all take notice: I ſay, the Scripture is not the Word of God, but a Declaration: the Scripture is but writing; and it is not the writing which is ihe Word, but the thing written of.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. T.</speaker>
               <p>Since ye are ſo ſhy of calling the Scriptures the word of God, will ye own them the words of God, the words of the Spirit of truth, which ſpake in thoſe ſervants of God, who were the Pen-men thereof? nothing was anſwered directly to this, but a multitude of words heaped up together about a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of, and the thing written of; of many words but little matter: why they ſhould be ſo ſhy of calling them (at leaſt) the words of God, I cannot ſay, unleſs they were afraid leaſt ſuch a grant ſhould have made us too neare together: For Chriſt uſeth both expreſſions, <hi>John.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Verely, verely, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.31. <hi>If ye continue in my Word,</hi> &amp;c.

               <speaker>P. T.</speaker>
               <p>We diſtinguiſh betweene the writing, and the thing written: it is not the writing as it is meer inke, and paper, but the thing written, which we own the Word of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Let us then at laſt, ſe wherein we agree, and wherein we differ: we ſay Chriſt is the Word of God, ſo ſay they; we ſay the Scriptures are they which teſtifie of Chriſt, ſo ſay they we ſay the Scripture is a Declaration of things to be beleeved, ſo ſay they: we ſay the writing is not the word of God, ſo ſay they.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. T.</speaker>
               <p>We ſay, that Chriſt is the eſſential word, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Declarative Word of God: not the meer writing, but the thing written: that divine, and heavenly Doctrin which is contained in theſe writings is the pure word of truth given in by the Spirit unto thoſe who were the Penmen of the Scriptures, and remaines unto us (unto this day) a rule in the letter concerning things to be beleeved, and practiced by us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I ſay the Scriptures Declare the Word of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not the Word; for that which declares, and that which is Declared, are not one and the ſame thing, but two.</hi>

               <p>And that thoſe holy men of God who writ the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, did both ſpeak and write, as they were moved by the holy Spirit.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>I ſay, the Letter, by a Figure: Before the argument was laid down, one of them called <hi>Quakers</hi> (whoſe name I know not) produced that text of the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out to the People, to hearken to the form of wholeſome words: <hi>who alſo hath made us able Miniſters of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not of the Letter, but of the Spirit, for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Apoſtle was a Miniſter of the word, and Goſpel of Chriſt, and he ſayes,</hi> not of the Letter, but of the Spirit: <hi>but thou ſayeſt the Letter is the Word of God, and wilt undertake to prove it: wilt thou then contradict the Apoſtle, and prove him a Miniſter of the Letter, when himſelf ſayes;</hi> not of the Letter, but of the Spirit?</p>

               <speaker>R. G.</speaker>
               <p>I ſaid, I would prove the Scriptures to be the Word of God, which I am ready to do; but ye are ſo full of words that

               <speaker>R. G.</speaker>
               <p>I lay it down in this argument: That which Chriſt, and his Apoſtles owned to be the word of God, is indeed, and in-truth, the Word of God, and ought to be ſo owned by us: But Chriſt, and his Apoſtles owned the Scriptures to be the Word of God: <hi>Ergo:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The aſſumption, or minor Propoſition <hi>R. G.</hi> proved by two texts of Scripture: the firſt, concerning Chriſts owning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word of God, I doe not well remember: but in ſtead of that, take another, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.13. <hi>Making the word of God of none authority by your tradition, which ye have ordained, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord Chriſt in the former part of the <hi>Chap:</hi> reproves the hypocriſie of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and tels them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>For ye lay aſide the Commands of God and obſerve the traditions of men:</hi> The 10th verſe makes it evident, that by the Commands of God, which they rejected; Chriſt means the law given from God to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was a written Law: and the ſame which he calls the Commands of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. he calls the word of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>making the word of God of none effect,</hi> or of none authority <hi>by your traditions,</hi> &amp;c. it relates to the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and more particularly to the fifth Commandement, <hi>Honour thy Father, and thy Mother,</hi> &amp;c. which was one of the ten, and written by the ſame hand as the reſt were; whence clearly appears, that Chriſt owned, and called the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law the Word of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. G.</speaker>
               <p>And that the Apoſtles owned the Scriptures to be the Word of God, will appear by comparing that text, 1 Theſſ. 2.13. with ſome others: <hi>For this cauſe alſo we thank God without ceaſing; that when ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us; ye received it not as the Word of man but as it is indeed the Word of God.</hi> You ſee in this text, that what the Apoſtle preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and theſe <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> received, was indeed, the word of God: Now that which the Apoſtle preached was no other, than what had been long before ſpoken, and written by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: For proof of this, ye may conſult, Act. 26.22. and 28.23. whence appears, that what was written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, was owned by the Apoſtle, as the Word of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Well, I will anſwer thee: The Apoſtle preached the Goſpell; and this we grant is the word, and power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto every one that beleeveth: the Goſpell is the word, and power of God, but not the Scriptures: and it is the Goſpel which the Apoſtle preached, and which the</hi> Theſſalonians <hi>received not as the word of man, but as it was indeed, the word of God: the Goſpel is the Word of God, the Scriptures are not.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. T.</speaker>
               <p>There is a twofold coming of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> in word, and ſecondly in power: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. and it is the ſame, the very ſame Goſpel of Chriſt in the hand of both Miniſtrations: the ſame Goſpel of Chriſt when it comes in word, and Letter, as when it comes in Spirit, and Power. Again the Apoſtle writ the ſame which he preached; he did not preach one thing, and write another; but the ſame Goſpel, and word of truth which he preached, the ſame he writ: if that therefore which he preached was not the word of man, but indeed the word of God; then that which he writ was alſo not the word of man, but truly, &amp; indeed the word of God. Let us here ad another text (though not then mentioned) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> cals that which the Prophets ſpake, and writ, the Word, (ye will not I hope ſay the word of man, but) the word of God in the mouth, and writings of the Prophets.</p>

               <p>Thoſe Doctrins of divine, and heavenly truth recorded, and delivered to us in the Scriptures, were the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, before committed to writing; and remaine the ſame in this day of the Scriptures, and ſhall be the ſame when the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> the writing ſhall be no more: but this doth not (at all) contradict what hath been aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> that the thing written is this word of God, the mind, will, and counſell of God given forth to us in writing, which we are to own, and follow as a Rule to us in all our wayes.</p>

               <p>You have been ſufficiently anſwered already, but you will receive none; onely go your Round in a circle. We do not affirm, that the ABC, &amp;c. or that words of the Scripture, as they conſiſt, and are made up of Letters, and ſyllables, are the Word of God; but that which is expreſt by theſe: The Spirit makes uſe of theſe words conſiſting of letters, and ſyllables to ſpeak to us, as we are able to bear, and to underſtand: and that which is here written, <hi>viz</hi> the mind, and meaning of the Spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in theſe words, in this writing, or Scripture, is that we call, and own the word of God; or the things of the Spirit of God Declared, and given forth to us in writing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing debated was concering Juſtification; which took up neare two hours time, wherein I ſpake little, by reaſon I could fully cloſe with neither party: In which diſcourſe words were multiplyed, and eſpecially by them called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who would oft-times ſpeak two or three ſucceſſively, giving way to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48717:8"/> none other: I thing, I may truely ſay, that I never ſpent ſo long time in hearing ſpirituall things ſpoken to, with leſſe profit: whatſoever it was to others, it was to me a moſt weariſome, and unprofitable Diſcourſe; which I ſhall leave till the laſt, and then give a breife hint of it.</p>
               <p>The third thing laid down formerly by <hi>E. B.</hi> for Doctrine, and now objected againſt by <hi>R. G.</hi> was,</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>That evill motions not conſented to, were not ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what plain contradiction is here, to own them evill and yet not ſin unleſſe conſented to? If evill motions, then are they a deviation from the holy, righteous, and good law of God, and conſequently, unrighteouſneſs: and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>All unrighteouſneſs is ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.17. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> layes it down more ſubtilly (for it is one of his Doctrines) when he ſayes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is not ſin unleſs conſented to: but to grant them evill motions, and yet deny them to be ſin till conſent be given; who can be ſo dull ſighted as not to ſee a plain contradiction in ſuch a poſition? if evil in their own nature, how can they be called otherwiſe then ſin, even before conſented to? if neither evil, nor ſin, how can conſent make them ſin?</p>

And ſecondly, As it is a juſt matter of reproof that which God doth reprove, and will (in his good time) fully deſtroy in his people: but while it abides, and dwells in them; it defiles, and is that which comes under reproof; and in theſe regards, ſin to them.</p>

It is ſometimes taken for grown men, who are called perfect, as being attained higher then others, though not yet come to the ſtate of full perfection: in this ſence, it is uſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. we find mention of a three-fold eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> Children, young men, and Fathers, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.13. which relates to a three-fold ſtature in Chriſt, the one higher then the other: there are perſons of a lower, and a higher form in Chriſt; the young men higher then the Children; and the Fathers higher then the young men, and yet not come up to the higheſt; for they are growing men ſtill, preſſing forward to what is before. And the ſame who are called Fathers, in this Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn,</hi> are by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> called perfect, in the two texts formerly mentioned: that is, Fathers in Chriſt, or men of higher attainments, and of a greater growth, both in knowledge, and in grace, then babes in Chriſt: theſe are ſaid to be perfect in compariſon of others, who are lower, and inferiour to them; yet were not theſe come up to the higheſt; for the Apoſtle, who was one of theſe perfect men, acknowledges himſelf in the ſame Chap. not to have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or to be already perfect; but he reached forth, and preſſed forward to what was before. And yet farther, we grant perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in every Saint, even in this life. Every degree of true, and ſpiritual light, every manifeſtation of divine, and heavenly glory in the Saints is perfection in its own nature: but the higheſt hereof is no more then ſomewhat of perfection dwelling in imperfect creatures; not ſuch a degree of perfection which ſwallowes up all imperfection.</p>

                  <hi>We read of a hundred forty, and foure thouſand, who ſtood with the Lambe upon mount Sion:</hi> Rev. 14.1. <hi>and of theſe it is ſaid</hi> ver. 5.

               <p>Theſe were without guile, as not being hypocrites, but ſincere, and upright-hearted towards God; and their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as to a being faultleſs before the throne of God) is to be underſtood in point of Juſtification not Sanctification; all truly beleeving in Chriſt are perfectly Juſtified, though not perfectly Sanctified in this life.</p>

               <p>I ſhall then begin with your laſt Text; <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not:</hi> we find in the ſame Chapt. verſ. 8. <hi>He that commits ſin is of the Devil;</hi> and between theſe two is a wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. 1. He that is born of God ſinneth not after the ſame rate, as thoſe, who are of the Devil; he chuſes not the way of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48717:11"/> ſin, nor yields up himſelf a ſervant to unrighteouſneſs: There is a Law in his members rebelling, yet can ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man,</hi> Rom. 7.22. His fals are weakneſs, not wilfulneſs; which is true of every Chriſtian, while he is, (as we may ſay) truly himſelf, and not under a temptation: <hi>David</hi> (in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>) ran very far, yea, ſinned preſumtuouſly, and wilfully, and with premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but it was (at this time) an hour of darkneſs upon him; he was now under temptation, and therefore acts not like a child of God, as at other times: A Chriſtian while under a cloud of temptation, is not indeed himſelf, neither can we (at ſuch a time) judge of him, or his eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſins not that ſin, which is unto death, (ſpoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.16.) Chriſt cals it blaſphemy againſt the holy Spirit, which ſhall never have forgiveneſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.29. He that is born of God ſinneth not this ſin; but as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, verſ. 18. <hi>He that is begotten of God keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Which I conceive is more directly the meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this Text; <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not:</hi> that is, ſo far as born of God; that which is born of God, or the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him doth not ſin; ſo far as he is acted by the pure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of light and life in him, the Spirit of truth received, he doth not commit ſin: the Spirit leads forth to nothing, but what is righteous and good; the fleſh to nothing but what is evil and ſinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17, 18.</p>
               <p>To your former Text; <hi>As he is,</hi> (viz. Chriſt) <hi>ſo are we in this world.</hi> I anſwer, it cannot be underſtood in the full latitude of it; that as Chriſt is, ſo are we. For 1. <hi>He is God over all, bleſſed for ever;</hi> ſo are not we: 2. <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt Jeſus) hath performed the office of a Mediator between God and Man; <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. He is the Mediator, ſo are not we: ye will not grant every man his own Mediator, and conſequently, ſo many perſons reconciled to God, ſo many Mediators; when the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>there is one God, and one Mediator; yet but one.</hi> 3. He is riſen from the dead, aſcended into heaven, and ſate down at the right hand of the Father in glory; ſo are not we: Yet in ſome other reſpects, <hi>as he is, ſo are we:</hi> but then we muſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48717:12"/> diſtinguiſh between the truth of the thing, and its manner; for things that are like, are not like altogether, and in all reſpects: for inſtance, 1. He is the Son of God, ſo are we; true in reſpect of the thing, but not in reſpect of the manner: Chriſt the Son of God by nature, and eternal generation; we the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, by the grace of Adoption. 2. In reſpect of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sanctification; <hi>as he is, ſo are we:</hi> true in reſpect of the thing, but not in reſpect of the manner; Chriſt was holy from his conception, and originally; but ſo are not we: we are ſanctified in time; he was perfectly juſt, and holy, without any blemiſh of ſin; ſo are not we; for there ſtill remains ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellings of ſin in us. 3. In reſpect of thoſe ſpiritual, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly vertues which ſhined forth in him; being meek and lowly, humble and ſelf-denying, patient towards all, and overcoming evil with good, &amp;c. <hi>as he is, ſo are we;</hi> true in reſpect of the things themſelves, but not in reſpect of the manner or meaſure: Every true Member of Chriſt, doth bear the image and likeneſs of Chriſt their Head; the ſame ſpiritual vertues, and true excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhine forth, both in the Head and Members; but with this difference,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What was and is in the Head originally, is found in the Members, only as dependants upon Chriſt their Head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What was in the Head to the height of perfection, is found in the Members, but to ſome degree.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What was in the Head, without any contrary thereto; is found in the Members, but with ſome contrary to it in the ſame ſubject; they are not perfectly light, there is darkneſs as well as light; fleſh as well as ſpirit in the Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. So then, <hi>with my mind, I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God; but with the fleſh the Law of Sin.</hi>

               <p>I ſpeak directly to your Friends words, who expreſſes himſelf; <hi>Search ye the Scriptures:</hi> which if it be a Command, and this Command reaches no further, than to the Unbeleeving World; to whom ſhall we conceive theſe Scriptures (in the judgement of your Friend) to be given, which this Text relates to? It is indeed clear, that theſe words were ſpoken directly to the Unbeleeving Jews; and are rather to be read, <hi>ye do ſearch the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal life, and theſe are they which teſtifie of me:</hi> which words are rather a reprehenſion, and reproof to the Jews to whom they are ſpoke; I ſay a reproof, not that they did ſearch the Scriptures, (for this is a commendable practice, and every Chriſtian mans duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11.) but that while they ſearched the Scriptures, they ſtill neglected him of whom the Scripture ſpake; they ſearched the Scriptures, but did not beleeve in him (Chriſt Jeſus the Meſſiah promiſed) of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> had written; and whom the Scriptures did teſtifie of: <hi>For they teſtifie of me, and ye will not come to me, verſ.</hi> 40. But now if you will have this a Command, and affirm, that this Scripture was given to the Unbeleeving World; what follows? but to thoſe that are commanded, and whoſe duty it is to ſearch into the Scriptures, are they given,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48717:13"/> yea, to theſe onely are they given: therefore if the Unbeleeving World are onely commanded to ſearch the Scriptures; can they be conceived to be given to any other: and thus he plainly owns (though he would ſeem to deny it) that the Scriptures were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the World, not to the Saints.</p>
               <p>I am of an eaſie belief, that <hi>E. B.</hi> when he mentioned that text of <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.29. <hi>Search ye the Scriptures:</hi> or, ye do ſearch the Scriptures; (which may be read either way) meant no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but theſe words (when ſpoken by Chriſt) were ſpoken to the unbeleeving Jews, which is true; but then it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that theſe words which were (at firſt) ſpoken to Unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, were written afterwards (the holy Spirit moving holy men of God to this work) for their ſakes onely to whom they were ſpoken; and conſequently that this Scripture was given onely to Unbeleevers, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Unbeleeving Jews) which were his very words, if he hath not forgotten himſelf.</p>
               <p>For firſt, what are recorded in Scripture, as things directed to ſome particular perſons, when ſpoken, were not written one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their ſakes to whom ſpoken; but according to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.17. <hi>Theſe things ſhall be written for generations to come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What was formerly ſpoken of, or ſpoken to Unbeleevers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and afterwards committed to writing (the holy Spirit moving hereunto) was not written meerly for ſuch in future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to whom they were (at firſt) ſpoken, (<hi>viz.</hi> Unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,) but for all ſorts of perſons to whom this Scripture ſhould come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.</p>
               <p>Yet thirdly, whatſoever was written by thoſe ſervants of God, who were the Pen-men of the holy Scripture, was written chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (though not onely) for the ſake and benefit of the Saints to the Worlds end; for their learning (in chief) was the Scripture given, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. and therefore that giddy Aſſertion (which is affirmed to have dropped from <hi>E.

               <p>No more was ſpoken to this, for the night grew on; and I think hardly any but were ſufficiently wearied with a confuſed and unprofitable Diſcourſe: The company beginning to break up, <hi>E.

G.</hi> concerning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he had preached (either a year, or years agone) in <hi>Bedfordſhire;</hi> but the people not caring to hear him any longer, he forbore to ſpeak farther as to that, and turned his diſcourſe to his own Proſelytes.</p>
               <p>How far <hi>E. B.</hi> owns the authority of the Scriptures of the New-Teſtament, doth not clearly appear; and whether he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Scriptures of the Old-Teſtament, as being of no uſe to the Saints, I am not able to ſay; but if this ſhould be in his, or in the heart of any of his followers; let that of the Apoſtle be conſulted with, (if the Scriptures, which himſelf in ſo many words owned to be given to the Saints, may be for ſatisfaction) <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>For whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning,</hi> &amp;c. Things written aforetime, relate to the Scriptures of the Old-Teſtament, to thoſe things written in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. and of theſe the Apoſtle affirms, they were written for our learning; which relates not to the World, but to the Saints; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle puts himſelf in the number of thoſe, for whoſe ſake (in chief) theſe things were written.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle indeed tels us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 24.22. wherefore Tongues are for a ſign, <hi>not to them that beleeve, but to them that beleeve not;</hi> but the ſame Apoſtle affirms the Scripture to be given, chiefly, for the ſake of the Saints, and ſuch who do beleeve, in the text for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned.</p>
               <p>There were ſome of the Company jealous of theſe men, leſt they might be <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> but I ſpeak freely my thoughts, I do not beleeve any ſuch thing concerning either of them; <hi>W.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48717:14"/> he had more than an ordinary art of hiding himſelf under a garbe of pretended ſimplicity; ſo that for my part, I do not judge or beleeve any ſuch thing concerning either of them; though I fear too many ſuch Deceivers are crept in among us, ſhrouding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under ſeveral Forms, where they can find moſt ſhelter; and of theſe, more who are <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in Principles, than <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in Orders; I apply it not to theſe, I hope better things of them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, (which was concerning Juſtification) I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over (in its proper place) but ſhall now give a brief hint of it, in the cloſe of this relation: It was very large, (with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of words on their part called <hi>Quakers</hi>) but as confuſed, and unprofitable a diſcourſe as ever I heard: The thing delivered for Doctrine by <hi>E.

               <p>Upon this, an ancient man of the company (whoſe name I knew not) deſired to hear from <hi>E.

               <p>He fully acknowledged the Hiſtory of Chriſts life and death; but concerning the end of Chriſts dying, he ſpake little, if any thing at all: I do not remember that his long confeſſion had any thing of that acknowledgement in it; <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. and yet (probable) he may own it; I believe he doth.</p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48717:16"/> &amp;c. Thoſe to whoſe charge nothing can be laid are compleately Juſtified: and you ſee clearly, that the Apoſtle owns it concerning the elect (or all who beleeve in Chriſt) there is none can lay any thing to their charge.</p>

               <p>Faith Juſtifies only inſtrumentally; it is not the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but the inſtrumental cauſe of our Juſtification: neither doth it Juſtifie inſtrumentally, as our work, or a work wrought in us by the Spirit, but with reſpect to its object Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And let me here add a word or two, (not then ſpoken.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. Juſtification by Grace, by Chriſt, by Faith, is all one and the ſame Juſtification; unto which all theſe concur as ſeveral cauſes reſpectively.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the merit or proper debt of Works; and the bare performance of ſomething called in the Scripture by the name of a work: The former, the Scripture every where denies in the point of Juſtification; but concerning the latter, the performance of ſomething called, and owned in the Scripture under the name of a work, it doth not deny; yea, it expreſly cals Faith a work, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. and this is required un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith hath a hand in this buſineſs of Juſtification, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than inſtrumentally.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith doth not Juſtifie inſtrumentally by vertue of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent worth, or excellency in it ſelf, (more than in Love or any other fruit of the Spirit) but by vertue of divine Inſtitution, as God hath appointed it to ſerve for this end, <hi>John</hi> 6.40.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall prove, and according to Scripture; that we are juſtified not by Faith onely, but by Works alſo; And it may be, if I read the words out of the Scripture, ye will have the more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to hear me.</hi> And reading certain verſes in the latter part of the ſecond Chapter of <hi>James,</hi> he with much carefulneſs, notes that in verſ. 24. <hi>Ye ſee then, how that by works a man is juſtified and not by Faith onely:</hi> having read to the end, he then carries on his Diſcourſe.<hi>Ye ſee they are the very words of the Apoſtle, and I hope, ye will not deny them; we ſpeak no other than according to the form of wholeſome words;</hi> that by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only; <hi>(but thou ſayeſt by faith onely) and to prove this truth, the Apoſtle (ye all ſee) brings two eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48717:17"/> the one of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the other of</hi> Rahab: <hi>what can be ſpoken more plainly, and proved more ſtrongly,</hi> that by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only? <hi>ſo was</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſo was</hi> Rahab <hi>juſtified; and ſo are we juſtified (at this day) by works and not by faith onely: By works, not our own works according to the Law, but the work of God in us; our own works which we our ſelves have wrought, or do work, are weak and imperfect, but the works of God in us, are all perfect and glorious, yea meritorious; we are not juſtified by ought our ſelves have done, or can do; all our own work of righteouſneſs is worthleſs and imperfect, but the works of God in us are of infinite vertue and worth.</hi>

               <p>The Apoſtle, in this latter part of the Chap. dealing with ſome who turned grace into wantonneſs, and boaſted of their faith without works; endeavours to convince ſuch of their great miſtake, and proves that true faith is never ſeparated from works of righteouſneſs; For though faith alone juſtifies; yet that faith which is alone doth not juſtifie; true faith being ever fruitfull, and working by love.</p>

And concerning <hi>Abraham;</hi> it is ſaid, Gen. 15.6. <hi>He beleeved in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs:</hi> Here is <hi>Abrahams</hi> Juſtification by faith cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, and owned by the Apoſtle, in oppoſion to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works according to the law, Rom. 4.2.3. And this was, before <hi>Abraham</hi> had ever a Child, which will clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if you conſult the Scriptures: So that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith before he went to offer up his ſon <hi>Iſaac;</hi> he was before that act of obedience, a juſtified perſon; therefore not juſtified hereby, but onely declared to be a true beleever; his faith was hereby clearely manifeſt; and no more can be drawn from this of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> if we do ſeriouſly weigh ver. 18, 19, 20. and compare what followes with theſe going before.</p>
               <p>And here ended this confuſed diſpute about Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in which point it is feared by ſome, that thoſe, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> if all of the ſame mind with <hi>E.

               <p>But if by juſtifying be meant that of abſolving, and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from guilt and condemnation, which is that the Apoſtle ſo often cals Juſtification; how will it agree with that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, &amp;c.</hi>

For what can that clauſe <hi>(in what they are led to fulfil by him)</hi> relate to, but a conformity to the righteous, holy, and good Law of God?

            <head>Several other Paſſages I have taken notice of in in this Book, ſome contradictory, others dark and doubtful, as to what is the Authors aim in them.</head>
            <p>PAge 4. Chap. 2. <hi>And this Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God is the light and life of the World, and hath enlightned all mankind; every one that cometh into the world is lighted by him with the true light of life, or condemnation:</hi> And page 22. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus the ſecond Adam lighteth every man, and all mankind that cometh into the World with the true light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How do theſe agree with that <hi>Page</hi> 25. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>Mans ſtate in the firſt Adam in tranſgreſſion is a ſtate of perfect enmity againſt God; and Death reigns in every man; and he is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with blindneſs, ignorance and unbelief, &amp;c?</hi> I ſay, how do theſe agree? unleſs there be granted a general reſtauration of all men, which yet you ſeem to deny in <hi>Page</hi> 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. where you acknowledge ſome to be in a ſtate unreconciled to God, and having no part nor portion in theſe things which belong to their peace.</p>
            <p>Page 10. lin. 1. <hi>Many profeſs them in words, what others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy of theſe things, but have not felt in themſelves the working of the eternal Spirit, neither have the witneſs in themſelves of being reſtored again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this latter clauſe a twofold queſtion ariſeth, for your words ſpeak not forth your meaning clearly. 1. Whether none are reſtored again, but thoſe that have the witneſs in themſelves. Or ſecondly, Whether all are reſtored, but ſome want the witneſs of this in themſelves? which you mean is doubtful.</p>
            <p>Page 10. Chap. 7. in the three laſt lines: <hi>This Religion and Worſhip ſtands in Chriſt Jeſus the ſecond Adam, who hath lighted every man that comes into the World, that all men through him might believe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48717:20"/>
            <p>Hence this queſtion ariſeth: Whether that light, which is in all and every particular man is ſufficient (without any thing farther of ſpeciall grace ſuperadded) to bring up every man to beleeve in Chriſt unto ſalvation; or to beleeve in God by meanes of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.</p>
            <p>Pag. 5. Chap. 3. <hi>This is the teſtimony of the Spirit of God, and it leadeth into all truth, and out of all evill, all that are guided by it; and it is given to be the guide, and rule of life to the Children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence this queſtion (for in theſe things he ſpeakes darkely, and doubtfully.) Whether the Spirit is ſo given to be the guide, and rule of life to the Saints, that they have no more need to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Chap. 19. After many other things, it follows pag. 28. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end; <hi>And the light of Chriſt in every one ſhall give teſtimony to it; unto which I do onely commend my ſelf, and theſe truths to be witneſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can theſe be wittneſſes to you, and of the truth in you, who are (as you ſay Pag. 6. Chap. 4.) ignorant of the life, power, and wiſedome of the Creatour, to leade, guide, and preſerve them, following the counſell of their own heart, which is evill altogether, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or, can ſuch judge between light, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, between truth, and falſehood; who are poſſeſſed with blindneſs, igorance, and unbeleife; and wholly imperfect to receive the things of Gods kingdom, or to act any thing for God acceptable to him; pag. 25. Chap. 19.</p>
            <p>Pag. 17. Chap. 13. <hi>It is truely ſaid; That the word of God was in the heart, and mouth of the ſervant of God, and that from it, they ſpake forth the Scriptures:</hi> and then followes, <hi>As they were moved by the holy ghoſt through the eternal Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you make the Holy Ghoſt, and eternall Spirit two? or what do you mean by Holy Ghoſt? it is, indeed a uſuall word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us (though there be little to bear up the uſe of it, more then long cuſtome) but by Holy Ghoſt, we mean the holy, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48717:20"/> eternall Spirit: what you mean wants an interpreter to find out, and make known, who ſeeme to make them two, becauſe you ſay, <hi>by the holy Ghoſt through the eternall Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 10. Chap. 7. <hi>This is true religion &amp;c.</hi> where is given forth the ſame deſcription of true Religion for ſubſtance, with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>James</hi> 1.26.27. and towards the end of the page, it is ſaid; <hi>This is acceptable, and well pleaſing to God above all words, and outward conformity, and ſet times, and dayes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is ſubſcribed to as honeſt, and true; and yet may a ſnake lie in this graſſe; The queſtion therefore offers it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a doing the greater things of the law is acceptable, where the leſſe are neglected? when it is ſaid, <hi>I will have mery, &amp; not ſacrifice</hi> (or mercy rather then ſacrifice, which is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) God did not ſo require mercy, as wholly to take off from Sacrifice; onely hereby is declared, that God prefers that before this; which is true unto this day; God requires to ſpeake the truth, and do the truth in all things; to do unto all men, as a man would be done unto; to love God with all our heart, and our neghbour as our ſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But hence will not follow an abolition of all inſtitute Worſhip, conſiſting in the uſe of ſuch Ordinances which Chriſt hath appointed, and which were in uſe among the Saints in the primitive times: God indeed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the former before this, but ſtil requires us to mind, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of Chriſt: Theſe things ye ought to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</p>
